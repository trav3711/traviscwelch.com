        <p>
            Currently a software engineer living in Seattle, WA messing around with comuters, riding bikes, and backpacking around the PNW. Formally I work for Infosys Ltd. as an Associate Software Engineer building data pipelines in Azure, but I think my real interests lie in system design and full-stack development. Eventual goal is build full SaaS as a one man operation and obtain both physical and financial freedom.

            Aside from my technical aspirations I've been studying Japanese for the past four years and am looking for a way to integrate that passion into my life in a more meaningful way. One of these I'll be able to return to Japan and live out my dreams of being the next <a href="https://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a>.

            Lastly is my love of backpacking and general outdoor activity. While I may not be the most energetic of outdoor folk, I do love walking up and down mountains and through the Cascades. Of my Covid activites, being able to backpacking through Washington's Enchantmens was one of the biggest highlights. Being a life long Eagle Scout, I've had a passionate with the outdoors since about the age of five and I don't see the possibility of a break-up anytime soon.
