This project required me to learn React.js which I still don't really know so I'll link the tutorials/resources I'm using below.

#### Tutorials used:
- [Scrimba's react tutorial](https://scrimba.com/course/glearnreact/enrolled) Which is really good, and I can't wait to finish it
- [Random Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-jn5tdg50) focused on building a portfolio, and less on how React.js works
- [React.js documentation](https://reactjs.org/) is also really great

#### Technologies Used

Just a list of technologies I'm using for styling, etc...
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
